# GPkit.jl
Adaptation of the GPML Gaussian Process Toolbox for Julia.

This is the initial load - still very rudimentary and very much WIP.

It does however work as per the examples shown in test/test.jl under Julia 0.3 and under 0.4 but with some deprecation warnings. Not all the computations have yet been checked in this released version of GPkit and any errors in translation from the GPML Toolbox resulting in incorrect algorithms or mathematics, are entirely mine.

Also, no Julia performance optimisation has been done as yet, so no benchmarks should be done (yet).

More to come.
